FEEDBACK:
Company policies and terms are living doccuments and while for the majority of cases 
we operate in compliance with these, for cases that fall outside the coverage of 
these policies, we reserve the right to decisions on our discretion.

We appreciate any feedback we can get in the process and strive to deliver the best 
experience that we can. Please feel free to contact us with any feedback or suggestion 
through a relevant channel from CONTACTS as mentioned at the top of this doccument.
